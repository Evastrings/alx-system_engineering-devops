What happens whenâ€¦

When you type "https://www.google.com" into your web browser and hit Enter, a complex series of actions is set in motion that ultimately results in the display of the Google search engine homepage on your screen. 

The Domain Name System (DNS) Lookup
The first step in the process is a DNS lookup. The browser sends a request to the DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address that can be understood by the computer. This is necessary because computers communicate using numerical IP addresses, not domain names.

The Request for Connection
Once the browser has obtained the IP address, it establishes a connection with the server using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, depending on the type of website being accessed. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect the data being transmitted.

The TLS Handshake
If the website is secured with HTTPS, a TLS handshake takes place to establish a secure connection between the browser and the server. This involves the exchange of a series of messages to establish encryption parameters and confirm the identities of both the browser and the server.

The HTTP Request
Once the connection has been established, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, requesting the content of the Google homepage. This request includes information such as the user agent, which identifies the browser and operating system being used, and any cookies associated with the domain.

The Server Response
The server receives the HTTP request and generates a response that includes the content of the Google homepage, as well as any additional information such as headers, metadata, and status codes. The response is then sent back to the browser over the established connection.

Rendering the Web Page
Finally, the browser receives the response and renders the Google homepage on the screen. This involves parsing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code contained in the response and displaying the resulting web page according to the browser's rendering engine.

In conclusion, the process of loading a web page such as Google involves multiple technical steps that take place behind the scenes. From the DNS lookup to the TLS handshake to the HTTP request and response, each step plays a crucial role in delivering the content of the website to the user's browser. Understanding this process can help users troubleshoot issues and optimize their browsing experience.
